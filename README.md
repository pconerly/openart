An example integration of pio.js using the British Library's flickr photos

## Running The Solution

You MUST add a config.json file under the `/app` dir with the following data:

````json
{
    "flickr_api_key":"api_key_here"
}

````

Then run `npm install` and `bower install`.

To run locally just run `grunt dev` and open your browser to `http://localhost:8081`.
